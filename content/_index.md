Welcome to the Space Coast DSA Organizing Committee home page.

Space Coast Democratic Socialists of America is a small group of dedicated activists, located in the Space Coast of Florida, aiming for the creation of a local chapter of [Democratic Socialists of America](http://www.dsausa.org "Democratic Socialists of America"), the largest socialist organization in the United States with about 24,000 members as of July 2017.

We are socialists because **we share a vision of a humane social order** based on democratic control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality, and LGBTQ liberation.

We are socialists because we are opposed to an economy organized for private profit that produces gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race and sex, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo.

We are socialists because we want to work together to develop a **concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for achieving a transition to democratic socialism** in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population. And we believe that only democratic movements and socialists parties can lead the way to a better world.
